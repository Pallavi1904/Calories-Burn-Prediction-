## 📊 Features

- ingested **7 key input features**:  
  `age`, `gender`, `height`, `weight`, `duration`, `heart_rate`, `body_temperature`  
- Extensive **Exploratory Data Analysis** (EDA): distributions, trends, and correlations  
- Applied **feature engineering** and preprocessing techniques  
- **Model training & comparison** using:
  - Linear Regression  
  - Decision Tree Regressor  
  - Random Forest Regressor  
  - XGBoost Regressor  
- Final model deployed using **pickle** for real-time predictions  
- Error metrics like **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** evaluated on a test split
